I'm a full-stack machine learning engineer and startup person. The latter is why I felt a need to have a full suite of SWE skills, but I'm re-focusing on AI now.
Currently looking for opportunities as a research/machine learning engineer. Email: elijah@0xeljh.com

My active projects:
- [pytorch-lightning-inspired backtester](https://github.com/0xEljh/backsim)
- [telegram bot to log your pod's EDH games](https://github.com/0xEljh/edh-telegram-bot)
- [my digital garden: blog + digital portfolio](https://0xeljh.com/)
- Also currently working on Unsloth's puzzle challenge for both the learning and the potential opportunity

some github highlights:
- 1inch fusion dashboard: got #1 dashboard at ETH Tokyo 2023 for this
- classic torch sgd: it's a one-line change but can make a big difference on custom learning rate algos
- Securities that support slippage models for `bt` can be found in my fork of it
